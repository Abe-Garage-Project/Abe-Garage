# Abe Garage backend API design and tasks

This package defines the backend implementation work for your four-person garage team. It contains 44 REST endpoint contracts and 6 shared infrastructure tasks, following the attached forum task archive’s structure: API documentation,implementation instructions,logic/Git workflow,PR checklist and Mermaid diagram. It is a design package; it does not implement or deploy the backend.

## Supporting files

- [Contract fixtures](contracts.json):all endpoint request/query/success response examples and ownership,for building mocks without waiting for teammates. Placeholders are not working credentials.
- foundation/:6 non-endpoint implementation and verification tasks.
- Every endpoint file has request body (or None),success JSON,permissions,error cases,business rules,dependencies,paths,Git instructions,acceptance checks and logic diagram.

## Sources

- User-provided garage requirements DOCX and UI ER diagram control project scope. Later conversation decisions override original examples: no v1,no /me,no Google,centralized errors,password reset,JWT token-version revocation.
- C:/Users/Yeabsira/Downloads/ai-powered-forum-project-main/tasks/backend.zip supplies the task-document format only. Its public forum registration/AI features are not garage requirements.
- C:/Users/Yeabsira/Downloads/EvangadiForum.zip supplies the reference controller/service/error flow; reusable reset JWT behavior was replaced by single-use hashed tokens.
- Technical references are linked in CONVENTIONS.md.

[Required fields,optional inputs and response variants](VALIDATION.md) complete the endpoint examples.

## Current database model

The normalized 14-table schema in ../../backend/db/schema.sql supersedes the original ten-table DATABASE-CHANGES proposal. Read ../database/README.md before implementing any SQL. URLs and outward JSON contracts are retained except the explicitly documented history-details mapping.


## Hybrid scaffold update

The entry point is now backend/index.js; the main router is backend/src/api/routes.js. Feature implementation files are empty and planned routes are documented rather than registered. Follow docs/TEAM-GUIDE.md for coding freedom; retain the agreed API behavior and normalized SQL mapping.
