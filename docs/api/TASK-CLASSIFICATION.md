# Backend task classification

One backend; module ownership separates work. API count does not equal effort. Member3 has the most complex business rules; Member2 takes technician job endpoints,Member4 owns mail and integration tests,Member1 supplies foundation early. This distribution reduces blocking but is not a claim of exactly equal workload.

| Member | Ownership | Coordination |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation,auth,employees,roles,settings,installation,health,deployment | Schema and shared middleware owner |
| 2 | Customers,vehicles,service catalogue,technician assignment/jobs/progress | Use Member3’s shared order status/locking/money contract |
| 3 | Order creation,detail,filters,estimate edits,approval,extra work,estimate data | Own order-domain business rules; support Member2 integration |
| 4 | Notification adapter,invoice,payment,public tracking,dashboard,acceptance collection | Offer fake mail and fixture orders immediately |

## Start without waiting

1. All four review CONVENTIONS and fixture contracts first. Member1 starts BE-001/002/003; others implement service units against fake auth context and repositories,not insecure production bypasses.
2. Member2 builds customer/vehicle/catalogue functions with local seed data. Member3 builds order-domain logic using fixture customer/vehicle/service records. Member4 builds mail adapter and invoices/tracking against fixture orders.
3. Member2 uses the shared order mutation helper for job updates; do not independently rewrite status rules. Agree function signatures before merging.
4. Dependencies in the board indicate required behavior for integration; a GET order read can be developed before create-order completes using seeded records. Avoid internal HTTP calls between modules.
5. Deliver small PRs,merge daily; blocked work goes to another ready card. Every endpoint owner supplies Postman/tests; Member4 coordinates rather than writes everyone’s tests.

## Suggested delivery gates

- Day1:shared contracts,foundation,seed data and mock adapters.
- Days2–3:login and master records,order creation basic.
- Days4–7:approval,job lifecycle,billing,tracking/email integration.
- Days8–9:all Must contracts implemented; scope freeze.
- Days10–12:cross-role,concurrency,privacy,performance and hosted tests.
- Days13–14:release verification,fixes and handover buffer.

Should features may be dropped only explicitly and consistently across API/screens. Password reset is a Must addition requested in conversation. Public live prices are treated as a release Should feature with an explicit scope check because they appear in scope but carry Should IDs in requirements.
