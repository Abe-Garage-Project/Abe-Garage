Examples use representative fixture records. Responses may have more/fewer array elements; fields and types are contractual. Nullable fields remain present as null. Where a task documents a restricted role projection, that projection replaces the general example for that role.

### Errors

- 400 Invalid input (unless this task specifies a different public-token rule)
- 401 Missing, invalid, expired or revoked access token
- 403 Inactive account or insufficient role
- 404 Customer, vehicle or service not found
- 409 Vehicle does not belong to customer
- 409 Customer or service is inactive
- 500 Unexpected server error

Shared error format (field errors apply to validation failures):

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "data": {
    "errors": {
      "email": "Enter a valid email address"
    }
  }
}
```

Non-validation errors use `data: null`, except explicitly documented safe metadata. See [shared conventions](../CONVENTIONS.md).

## 2. Instructions

1. Define route and middleware in `backend/src/api/orders/routes/order.route.js`.
2. Add `createOrderValidation` in `backend/src/api/orders/validations/order.validation.js`.
3. Implement `createOrderController` in `backend/src/api/orders/controller/order.controller.js`. Extract allowlisted inputs and verified actor context only.
4. Implement `createOrderService` in `backend/src/api/orders/service/order.service.js`. Keep business rules and SQL out of controllers.
5. Share transactions, money/status helpers and notification adapter as described in foundation tasks; do not duplicate other modules’ logic.
6. On errors call `next(error)` from controller catches or use the shared async wrapper. Do not send competing error formats.

## 3. Logic & Git Instructions

### Logic steps

1. Validate customer,vehicle,nonempty lines array (max 100), future estimated_ready_date and notes lengths. Unknown fields are rejected; client cannot set status,totals,hash,paid,creator or invoice fields.
2. In one transaction lock customer/vehicle and selected services; verify active customer, vehicle ownership and active unique service IDs. Reject a car belonging to another customer (409).
3. Copy service name,description,labor_hours and price to order_lines snapshots. Optional custom line_price follows BE-032/BE-034 policy; server always computes totals. New lines are unassigned.
4. Read settings.vat_rate into orders.vat_rate, sum prices in integer minor units, round VAT once on subtotal, and persist subtotal/vat/total. Example 230.00 + 34.50 = 264.50.
5. Set status=1,paid=false, created_by from token; create 32-byte random hex order_hash and initial history. Roll back all rows on any failure.
6. After commit call shared notification adapter (BE-043) for order_created email. Delivery failure cannot change successful 201 or roll back order. Record email_sent/email_failed history separately. Return full order; client may refetch detail to see delivery outcome.

### Git workflow

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
git checkout -b codex/be-029-create-order
# Implement and run task-specific checks
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "[BE-029] Create repair order and estimate"
git push -u origin codex/be-029-create-order
```

Open a PR into dev with requirement IDs, examples and test evidence. One teammate reviews. Coordinate shared route registration through Member 1; module files belong to their listed owner.

### PR checklist and acceptance criteria

- [ ] Successful request returns 201 and exactly the documented safe response shape.
- [ ] Missing/expired/revoked token returns401; inactive account and unauthorized role return403.
- [ ] Verify 404 Customer, vehicle or service not found.
- [ ] Verify 409 Vehicle does not belong to customer.
- [ ] Verify 409 Customer or service is inactive.
- [ ] Invalid/unknown input fields are rejected; no unexpected database changes occur on failure.
- [ ] Transaction/concurrency behavior and repeated-request behavior match the logic below.
- [ ] All errors go through centralized error middleware; no sensitive fields or stack traces escape.
