Examples use representative fixture records. Responses may have more/fewer array elements; fields and types are contractual. Nullable fields remain present as null. Where a task documents a restricted role projection, that projection replaces the general example for that role.

### Errors

- 400 Invalid input (unless this task specifies a different public-token rule)
- 401 Missing, invalid, expired or revoked access token
- 403 Inactive account or insufficient role
- 404 Order not found
- 409 Order is not editable in this state
- 409 Cannot modify performed work or issued invoice lines
- 500 Unexpected server error

Shared error format (field errors apply to validation failures):

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "data": {
    "errors": {
      "email": "Enter a valid email address"
    }
  }
}
```

Non-validation errors use `data: null`, except explicitly documented safe metadata. See [shared conventions](../CONVENTIONS.md).

## 2. Instructions

1. Define route and middleware in `backend/src/api/orders/routes/order.route.js`.
2. Add `updateOrderValidation` in `backend/src/api/orders/validations/order.validation.js`.
3. Implement `updateOrderController` in `backend/src/api/orders/controller/order.controller.js`. Extract allowlisted inputs and verified actor context only.
4. Implement `updateOrderService` in `backend/src/api/orders/service/order.service.js`. Keep business rules and SQL out of controllers.
5. Share transactions, money/status helpers and notification adapter as described in foundation tasks; do not duplicate other modules’ logic.
6. On errors call `next(error)` from controller catches or use the shared async wrapper. Do not send competing error formats.

## 3. Logic & Git Instructions

### Logic steps

1. Lock order first. In status=1, allow replacing the entire unstarted lines array plus notes/date; retain existing line IDs and assignments for retained services, snapshot fresh data for new services, and remove only unstarted unapproved lines.
2. If a reapproval order already has started/done work, do not remove or reprice those lines. Awaiting approval alone does not authorize rewriting previously performed work.
3. After approval (status 2/3/4), only notes_for_customer,internal_notes and estimated_ready_date may change. Declined orders are read-only. Billing issuance prevents all line/price edits.
4. Custom nonnegative line_price is a Should feature; if implemented, use same policy at creation and update. Unspecified prices for retained lines keep their snapshot; new lines copy current service price. At least one line remains; no duplicate services.
5. Never permit customer_id,vehicle_id,paid,status,vat_rate or calculated totals in update. Recalculate totals from retained snapshots using stored vat_rate and append descriptive history.
6. Return full Manager/Admin detail. For already completed orders do not accept a new future readiness date that contradicts completion; notes remain editable.

### Git workflow

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
git checkout -b codex/be-032-update-order
# Implement and run task-specific checks
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "[BE-032] Edit estimate or order notes"
git push -u origin codex/be-032-update-order
```

Open a PR into dev with requirement IDs, examples and test evidence. One teammate reviews. Coordinate shared route registration through Member 1; module files belong to their listed owner.

### PR checklist and acceptance criteria

- [ ] Successful request returns 200 and exactly the documented safe response shape.
- [ ] Missing/expired/revoked token returns401; inactive account and unauthorized role return403.
- [ ] Verify 404 Order not found.
- [ ] Verify 409 Order is not editable in this state.
- [ ] Verify 409 Cannot modify performed work or issued invoice lines.
- [ ] Invalid/unknown input fields are rejected; no unexpected database changes occur on failure.
- [ ] Transaction/concurrency behavior and repeated-request behavior match the logic below.
- [ ] All errors go through centralized error middleware; no sensitive fields or stack traces escape.
