# Request field and response variants

All request examples are concrete examples,not JSON Schema. This table defines presence rules. Unknown fields are rejected. A required field cannot be null; omitted optional fields use the stated default. PATCH accepts only listed mutable fields,at least one. IDs are positive integers and decimal strings accept exactly the precision/range in CONVENTIONS.

| Endpoint/task | Required input | Optional input/default |
|---|---|---|
| BE-004 login | email,password | None |
| BE-005 forgot password | email | None |
| BE-006 reset password | token,new_password | None |
| BE-007 change password | current_password,new_password | None |
| BE-009 employee create | first_name,last_name,email,phone,password,role_id | active=true |
| BE-012 employee patch | At least one permitted field | first_name,last_name,email,phone,role_id,active;omission preserves current value |
| BE-015 settings patch | At least one permitted field | name,address,phone,email,vat_rate |
| BE-016 customer create | first_name,last_name,email,phone | active=true |
| BE-019 customer patch | At least one permitted field | first_name,last_name,email,phone,active |
| BE-020 vehicle create | customer_id,year,make,model,type,mileage,plate,color | vin=null |
| BE-023 vehicle patch | At least one permitted field | year,make,model,type,mileage,plate,vin,color;vin may be null |
| BE-025 service create | name,description,price,labor_hours | active=true |
| BE-027 service patch | At least one permitted field | name,description,price,labor_hours,active |
| BE-029 order create | customer_id,vehicle_id,lines (1..100),estimated_ready_date | notes_for_customer=null,internal_notes=null;line_price optional per line if custom pricing implemented |
| BE-032 order patch | At least one permitted field | lines,estimated_ready_date,notes_for_customer,internal_notes;notes may be null;state restrictions apply |
| BE-033 approval | decision,approval_method | decision approved or declined;method phone or in_person |
| BE-034 extra job | service_id | line_price=current service price |
| BE-035 assign | technician_id | None;unassign unsupported |
| BE-037 job progress | line_status | Only1(start) or2(done);0 is not a new transition target |
| BE-038 work note | technician_note | null clears note;otherwise max2000 chars |
| BE-042 payment | paid=true | No client amount,date,collector or method |
| BE-040 invoice issue / BE-045 resend / BE-047 install | No JSON body | Reject unexpected input;install seed from env |
| Every GET | No JSON body | Only endpoint-documented query parameters |

## Role projections and state variants

- GET employees Admin fields:employee_id,first_name,last_name,email,phone,role_id,role_name,active,created_at. Manager fields:employee_id,first_name,last_name,role_name. Same employees/pagination wrapper.
- GET order Technician projection:remove customer.email,customer.phone,internal_notes,order_hash,tracking_url;retain permitted order/vehicle/job/history data. Manager/Admin receive full example. Public tracking uses a completely separate allowlist.
- Approval decline response has same keys as approval but status5,status_name Declined,approved_by=null,approved_at=null. approval_method retains recorded channel; actor/time/decision recorded in history.details. Reapproval can derive status3/4.
- Repeating invoice issuance returns200 rather than201 with identical issued document. Repeating paid=true returns200 with original payment metadata. Job-status replay returns current parent status and original line timestamps,not a fabricated new start/completion.
- Resend failure example:HTTP503,{status:error,message:Email could not be sent,data:{order_id:24,email_status:failed}}. Strings shown here without quotes for readability;actual HTTP bodies are valid JSON. Automatic send failures never replace order201/completion200.
- Empty list response uses resource array=[],pagination:{page:1,limit:10,total:0,total_pages:0};past-end pages retain actual total/total_pages.
- Every error uses the shared envelope; validation error keys match offending fields such as employee_id,lines,token or email. The email error block in task documents illustrates shared structure,not a mandatory field for every route.

## HTTP status distinctions

400 malformed fields;401 authentication failure/revocation;403 denied role/inactive caller;404 missing record;409 existing conflicting record or invalid business state;429 rate limit;500 internal failure;503 controlled unavailable dependency. Public reset/tracking exceptions follow their task contract.

## Integration ownership

Member3 provides shared helpers calculateOrderTotals(lockedOrder,lines),deriveOrderStatus(lines),assertOrderMutationAllowed(order,operation),and appendOrderHistory(connection,event). Member2 uses them for technician mutations. Member4 uses totals/snapshots without rewriting calculation rules. Function names are proposed interfaces to agree on Day1;use explicit connection argument for transaction-aware calls.
