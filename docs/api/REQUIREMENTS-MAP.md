## Intentional differences from source examples

- /api without v1; plural resources; PATCH partial updates; Authorization:Bearer instead of x-access-token.
- Central {status,message,data} response; reference task archive’s {success,user,token} examples are not copied as garage conventions.
- /api/profile instead of /me; login response contains access_token and employee.
- POST /api/install changes state; HTTP installer locks after setup. Idempotent internal migrations resolve the document’s competing repeat-success/locked-public-route requirements.
- Invoice POST separates issuance from safe GET read. Extra invoice/snapshot columns explicitly proposed,not silently assumed.
- Member2 owns technician endpoints to rebalance Member3 workload. No microservices or separate deployments.
- Reapproval decline with already performed work is409 rather than closing performed work; expanded cancellation/credit handling deferred.
- Monetary example230.00 +15% uses ETB as a proposed single launch currency,not a currency conversion from source’s dollar example. Team confirms currency before launch.
